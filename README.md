## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 installed on your 
system.

## Building the Project

This project uses the **Gradle Wrapper**, so you do not need to install Gradle separately.

./gradlew build

# On Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell)
gradlew.bat build
